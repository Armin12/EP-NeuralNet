# EP-NeuralNet

In this project, we trained Artificial Neural Networks using Equilibrium Propagation algorithm (EP) for two classification problems: 1) classification of Iris data 2) Performing XOR logical operation. 
Fully connected Continuous Hopfield Nets with symmetrical weights were used to show the flexibility of EP in learning complex structures.

Details about the Equilibrium Propagation algorithm are published [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2017.00024/full)
